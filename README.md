This is a simple notification program that shows an icon in the Windows tray notification.
It displays the current Octopus agile price, click it ot show a list of future prices. Click again to hide.

There's some settings where you can change the font (Segoe UI is the default, but Microsoft is not good at coding anymore so be careful choosing a non-standard style like semibold)
Consolas and Tahoma work well too.

Text and background colours can be changed for bands of prices. Set background to transparent if you want it to keep your taskbar colour.

To install, unpack the zip folder and run the OctopusAgileNotification.exe file. You might want to set the taskbar settings to always show it.
